## Grammar
Let's start with notes first. You can assign a note literal to a variable as below:

    $note = Co4;
This one line code assigns a standard C literal to the variable $note. The literal nomenclature is based on [Scientific Pitch Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation). Although the pitch letter and octave sign are case insensitive, we recommend you to use uppercase for the pitch and lowercase for the octave.
To represent the flat/sharp note, you can use +/-:

    $note1 = C+o4; $note2 = D-o4;

To modify the duration of a note, multiplication and division operators are supported, e.g.

    $note1 = Co4; $note2 = $note2/16; $note3 = Co4/16
    # $note1 is a standard C whole note, $note2 and $note3 are both standard C semiquaver notes.
Sometimes you may want to have a note which is in the same pitch as a variable, but not the same duration, you can use operator "//" to do norm division (normalize then divide by).

    $note1 = Co4/16; $note2 = $note1//8; $note3 = $note1*2
$note2 and $note3 are both standard C quaver notes, while $note2 is generated by a norm division.
